# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Mark Muthii

This is a log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge, started on November 20th, 2023.

The goal with the challenge is to build a SaaS product, and so I am combining it with the #buildinpublic challenge. Progress will be shared on X (formerly Twitter) [@KramCodes](https://x.com/KramCodes) and on my Instagram account [@kram.codes](https://instagram.com/kram.codes).

## Log

### R1D1 - November 20th, 2023

Created the database schema for the SaaS product. I will be using a relational database (MySQL).

The initial schema is simply a guide, and will be updated as the product evolves.

### R1D2 - November 21st, 2023

Created the initial server structure and the models and migrations for two of the tables in the database schema.

### R1D3 - November 22nd, 2023

Worked on the authentication API. Set up the initial client structure and installed Shadcn UI.

### R1D4 - November 23rd, 2023
